        <p>At the end of February, I applied to three Universities in hopes of getting into a Pre-Vet program. My goal was to get into the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus in Truro. I also applied to the University of PEI and Crandall University, just in case I didn't get into Dal. After a couple of weeks I received an acceptance letter from UPEI and then an acceptance letter from Crandall. This was, of course, very exciting. However, I'd really set my heart on Dal, especially after visiting the campus. Then I received a letter saying that I had been accepted to King's College. It was both incredibly disappointing and confusing  . I hadn't even applied to King's College! Or so I thought. It turns out that King's College operates under Dalhousie and my transcript and application had been sent there instead of Dal AC. All that to say, my transcript and application were transferred and I have been <em>accepted</em> to the Animal Sciences degree and to the undeclared Pre-Vet program at the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus!  </p>

        <p>The Dalhousie campus is <em>amazing</em>! The various degrees that can be taken at Dal make for an incredibly diverse campus.  My family and I were guided through the labs and lecture halls that I will likely be learning in. We saw the aquaculture center and one of the many greenhouses. I can't wait to see the campus in the spring when the gardens that the botanists planted for the entomologists are in bloom. Of course, my favourite part was touring the rumanant barns. That's where I will probably be spending the majority of my free time.  I am going to sign up for a program  where students are assigned a rumanant (sheep or cows) to train and show in a competition at the end of the year, something I've always wanted to try. Although I'm not looking forward to leaving home, I <em>am</em> excited for the unversity experience.</p>
